===Introduce===
Joanne Rowling (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/ ⓘ ROH-ling;[1] CH OBE born 31 July 1965), known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She is the author of Harry Potter, a seven-volume fantasy novel series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 600 million copies, been translated into 84 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith.

Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.

The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. There were also religious debates over the Harry Potter series.

Rowling has won many accolades for her work. She has been appointed an OBE and a Member of the Companions of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. Harry Potter brought her wealth and recognition, which she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. She established the Volant Charitable Trust in 2000, and co-founded the charity Lumos in 2005. Rowling's philanthropy centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children. In 2012, Forbes estimated that Rowling's charitable giving totalled US$160 million. She has also donated to Britain's Labour Party, and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit.

Since 2017, Rowling has been vocal about her gender-critical opinions on transgender people and related civil rights. Her comments have been described as transphobic, which she disputes, and have fuelled debates on freedom of speech and cancel culture, and prompted declarations of support for transgender people from the culture sector.
===Life===
Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire,[8][b] to a middle-class family.[10] Her parents Anne (née Volant) and Peter ("Pete") James Rowling had met the previous year on a train, sharing a trip from King's Cross station, London, to their naval postings at Arbroath, Scotland. Rowling's mother was with the Wrens and her father with the Royal Navy.[14] Pete Rowling was the son of a machine-tool setter who later opened a grocery shop.[15] They left the navy life and sought a country home to raise the baby they were expecting,[15] and married on 14 March 1965[10] when both were 19.[16] The Rowlings settled in Yate,[17] where Pete started work as an assembly-line production worker at the Bristol Siddeley factory.[15] The company became part of Rolls-Royce,[18] and he worked his way into management as a chartered engineer.[19] Anne Rowling later worked as a science technician.[20] Neither of Rowling's parents attended university.[21]

Rowling is two years older than her sister, Dianne,[10] whose birth was Rowling's earliest memory.[22] When she was four, Rowling's family moved to Winterbourne, Gloucestershire.[16][23] She began at St Michael's Church of England Primary School in Winterbourne when she was five.[10][c] The Rowlings lived near a family called Potter – a name Rowling always liked.[26][d] Rowling's mother liked to read and the family's homes were filled with books.[27] Her father read The Wind in the Willows to his daughters,[28] while her mother introduced them to the animals in Richard Scarry's books.[29] Rowling's first attempt at writing, a story called "Rabbit" composed when she was six, was inspired by Scarry's creatures.[29]

When Rowling was about nine, the family purchased the historic Church Cottage in Tutshill.[30][e] In 1974, Rowling began attending the nearby Church of England School.[34] Biographer Sean Smith describes her teacher as a "battleaxe"[35] who "struck fear into the hearts of the children";[36] Rowling's teacher seated her in "dunces' row" after she performed poorly on an arithmetic test.[37][f] In 1975, Rowling joined a Brownies pack. Its special events and parties, and the pack groups (Fairies, Pixies, Sprites, Elves, Gnomes and Imps) provided a magical world away from her stern teacher.[40] When she was eleven[41] or twelve, she wrote a short story, "The Seven Cursed Diamonds".[42] She later described herself during this period as "the epitome of a bookish child – short and squat, thick National Health glasses, living in a world of complete daydreams".[43]

Secondary school and university

Rowling's secondary school was Wyedean School and College, a state school she began attending at the age of eleven[44] and where she was bullied.[45][46] Rowling was inspired by her favourite teacher, Lucy Shepherd, who taught the importance of structure and precision in writing.[47][48] Smith writes that Rowling "craved to play heavy electric guitar",[49] and describes her as "intelligent yet shy".[50] Her teacher Dale Neuschwander was impressed by her imagination.[51] When she was a young teenager, Rowling's great-aunt gave her Hons and Rebels, the autobiography of the civil rights activist Jessica Mitford.[52] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and she read all her books.[53]

Anne had a strong influence on her daughter.[10] Early in Rowling's life, the support of her mother and sister instilled confidence and enthusiasm for storytelling.[54] Anne was a creative and accomplished cook,[55][g] who helped lead her daughters' Brownie activities,[58] and took a job in the chemistry department at Wyedean while her daughters were there.[20] The three walked to and from school together, with a relationship more like sisters than mother and daughters.[tone][49][59] John Nettleship, the head of science at Wyedean, described Anne as "absolutely brilliant, a sparkling character ... very imaginative".[11] Anne was diagnosed with a "virulent strain" of multiple sclerosis when she was 34[60] or 35 and Jo was 15,[61] and had to quit her job.[62] Rowling's home life was complicated by her mother's illness[63] and a strained relationship with her father.[64] Rowling later said "home was a difficult place to be",[65] and that her teenage years were unhappy.[32] In 2020, she wrote that her father would have preferred a son and described herself as having severe obsessive–compulsive disorder in her teens.[66] She began to smoke, took an interest in alternative rock,[60] and adopted Siouxsie Sioux's back-combed hair and black eyeliner.[11] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia that provided an escape from her difficult home life and the means for Harris and Rowling to broaden their activities.[67][h]

Living in a small town with pressures at home, Rowling became more interested in her schoolwork.[60] Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English".[32] Rowling took A-levels in English, French, and German, achieving two As and a B, and was named head girl at Wyedean.[70] She applied to Oxford University in 1982 but was rejected.[10] Biographers attribute her rejection to privilege, as she had attended a state school rather than a private one.[71][72]

Rowling always wanted to be a writer,[73] but chose to study French and the classics at the University of Exeter for practical reasons, influenced by her parents who thought job prospects would be better with evidence of bilingualism.[74] She later stated that Exeter was not initially what she expected ("to be among lots of similar people – thinking radical thoughts") but that she enjoyed herself after she met more people like her.[53] She was an average student at Exeter, described by biographers as prioritising her social life over her studies, and lacking ambition and enthusiasm.[75][76] Rowling recalls doing little work at university, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien.[32] She earned a BA in French from Exeter,[77] graduating in 1987 after a year of study in Paris.[78]
===Performances===
In 1999, Warner Bros. purchased film rights to the first two Harry Potter novels for a reported $1 million.[146][147] Rowling accepted the offer with the provision that the studio only produce Harry Potter films based on books she authored,[148] while retaining the right to final script approval,[149] and some control over merchandising.[147] Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, an adaptation of the first Harry Potter book, was released in November 2001.[150] Steve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film,[151] with Rowling's assistance, ensuring that his scripts kept to the plots of the novels.[152] The film series concluded with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which was adapted in two parts; part one was released on 19 November 2010,[153] and part two followed on 15 July 2011.[154]

Warner Bros. announced an expanded relationship with Rowling in 2013, including a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, fictitious author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.[155] The first film of five, a prequel to the Harry Potter series, set roughly 70 years earlier, was released in November 2016.[156] Rowling wrote the screenplay, which was released as a book.[157] Crimes of Grindelwald was released in November 2018.[158] Secrets of Dumbledore was released in April 2022.[159] In November 2022, Variety reported that Warner Bros. Discovery was not actively planning to continue the film series or to develop any further films related to the Wizarding World franchise.[160]

Religion, wealth and remarriage

By 1998, Rowling was portrayed in the media as a "penniless divorcee hitting the jackpot".[130] According to her biographer Sean Smith, the publicity became effective marketing for Harry Potter,[130] but her journey from living on benefits to wealth brought, along with fame, concerns from different groups about the books' portrayals of the occult and gender roles.[161] Ultimately, Smith says that these concerns served to "enhance [her] public profile rather than damage it".[162]

Rowling identifies as a Christian.[163] Although she grew up next door to her church,[164] accounts of the family's church attendance differ.[n] She began attending a Church of Scotland congregation, where Jessica was christened, around the time she was writing Harry Potter.[166] In a 2012 interview, she said she belonged to the Scottish Episcopal Church.[167] Rowling has stated that she believes in God,[168] but has experienced doubt,[169] and that her struggles with faith play a part in her books.[90] She does not believe in magic or witchcraft.[163][168]

Rowling married Neil Murray, a doctor, in 2001.[5] The couple intended to marry that July in the Galapagos, but when this leaked to the press, they delayed their wedding and changed their holiday destination to Mauritius.[170] After the UK Press Complaints Commission ruled that a magazine had breached Jessica's privacy when the eight-year-old was included in a photograph of the family taken during that trip,[171][172] Murray and Rowling sought a more private and quiet place to live and work.[173] Rowling bought Killiechassie House and its estate in Perthshire, Scotland,[174] and on 26 December 2001, the couple had a small, private wedding there, officiated by an Episcopalian priest who travelled from Edinburgh.[5] Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born in 2003,[175] and their daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray in 2005.[176]

In 2004, Forbes named Rowling "the first billion-dollar author".[177] Rowling denied that she was a billionaire in a 2005 interview.[178] By 2012, Forbes concluded she was no longer a billionaire due to her charitable donations and high UK taxes.[179] She was named the world's highest paid author by Forbes in 2008,[180] 2017[181] and 2019.[182] Her UK sales total in excess of £238 million, which made her the best-selling living author in Britain,[183] until 2025 when she was supplanted by Julia Donaldson.[184] The 2021 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £820 million, ranking her as the 196th-richest person in the UK.[185] As of 2020, she also owns a £4.5 million Georgian house in Kensington and a £2 million home in Edinburgh,[186] where she lives with Murray and her two youngest children.[8]

Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith

In mid-2011, Rowling left Christopher Little Literary Agency and followed her agent Neil Blair to the Blair Partnership. He represented her for the publication of The Casual Vacancy, released in September 2012 by Little, Brown and Company.[187] It was Rowling's first since Harry Potter ended, and her first book for adults.[188] A contemporary take on 19th-century British fiction about village life,[189] Casual Vacancy was promoted as a black comedy,[190] while the critic Ian Parker described it as a "rural comedy of manners".[32] It was adapted to a miniseries co-created by the BBC and HBO.[191]

Little, Brown and Company also published The Cuckoo's Calling, the purported début novel of Robert Galbraith, in April 2013.[192] Telling the story of detective Cormoran Strike, a disabled veteran of the War in Afghanistan,[193] it initially sold 1,500 copies in hardback.[194] After an investigation prompted by discussion on Twitter, the journalist Richard Brooks contacted Rowling's agent, who confirmed Galbraith was Rowling's pseudonym.[194] Rowling later said she enjoyed working as Robert Galbraith,[195] a name she took from Robert F. Kennedy, a personal hero, and Ella Galbraith, a name she invented for herself in childhood.[196] After the revelation of her identity, sales of Cuckoo's Calling escalated.[197]

Continuing the Cormoran Strike series of detective novels, The Silkworm was released in 2014;[198] Career of Evil in 2015;[199] Lethal White in 2018;[200] Troubled Blood in 2020;[201] The Ink Black Heart in 2022;[202] and The Running Grave in 2023.[203] In 2017, BBC One aired the first episode[204] of the five-season series Strike, a television adaptation of the Cormoran Strike novels starring Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger, with a sixth season being shot in 2024.[205][206] The series was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.[207]

In September 2024, Rowling tweeted that she had begun work on a futuristic novel; she added that there were three different projects she could turn to, once the tenth and final planned Strike novel had been published.[208]
